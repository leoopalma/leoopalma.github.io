    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Trans art in Italy is a collection of resources about Italian trans art histories. Given the scarcity of scholarly studies on this topic, and that they are often difficult to find and access, this website hopes to be a starting point for students, independent researchers, and all who are interested. Currently it compiles a syllabus on the topic, with links to where to read or buy the material, and a list of relevant artists. </p>
